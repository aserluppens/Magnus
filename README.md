# Magnus
Determine the maximum number of HONI-blocks we can get in a word

Problem coci18c3p1 from DMOJ

"Magnus lost a game of chess to Kile so he found comfort in competitive programming. Very soon, he heard of the iconic COCI competition and decided to try his luck there.

He wrote a mail to Kile: "Dear Kile, please, prepare me for COCI. Magnus".

Kile replied: "You want to participate in COCI? All right, here's your warm-up task. A series of four consecutive letters of some word that make up the subword "HONI"
(Croatian acronym for COCI) is called the HONI-block. I will send you the word of length N and you will throw out as many letters as you want (it might be none as well)
so that in the end there are as many HONI-blocks as possible in the word. Kile".

Magnus was very worried and asked you, COCI competitive scene, for help. Help him determine the maximum number of HONI-blocks he can get in the final word."

Input:
The first line contains a word of length N(1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000) , consisting of uppercase letters of the English alphabet.

Output:
In the first and only line, print out the required number of HONI-blocks.
